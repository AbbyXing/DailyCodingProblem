# Problem #20: Intersection of Two Linked Lists (Easy)

## Asked By:

This problem was asked by Google.

## Description:
 
Given two singly linked lists that intersect at some point, find the intersecting node. The lists are non-cyclical.

## Example:

For example, given A = 3 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10 and B = 99 -> 1 -> 8 -> 10, return the node with value 8.  

In this example, assume nodes with the same value are the exact same node objects.

## Note:

Do this in O(M + N) time (where M and N are the lengths of the lists) and constant space.
