# Problem #11: Prefix Query Match (Medium)

## Asked By:

This problem was asked by Twitter.

## Description:
 
Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string `s` and a set of all possible query strings, return all strings in the set that have s as a prefix.

## Example:

For example, given the query string `de` and the set of strings `[dog, deer, deal]`, return `[deer, deal]`.


## Note:

Hint: Try preprocessing the dictionary into a more efficient data structure to speed up queries.
