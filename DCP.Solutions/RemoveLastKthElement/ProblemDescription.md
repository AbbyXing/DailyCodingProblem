# Problem #26: Remove The Last Kth Element From LinkedList (Medium)

## Asked By:

This problem was asked by Google.

## Description:
 
Given a singly linked list and an integer k, remove the kth last element from the list. k is guaranteed to be smaller than the length of the list.  

The list is very long, so making more than one pass is prohibitively expensive.

## Example:

N/A.

## Note:

Do this in constant space and in one pass.
