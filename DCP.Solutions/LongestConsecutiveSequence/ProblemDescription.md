# Problem #99: Longest Consecutive Sequence (Hard)

## Asked By:

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

## Description:
 
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

## Example:

For example, given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2], the longest consecutive element sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Return its length: 4.

## Note:

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
