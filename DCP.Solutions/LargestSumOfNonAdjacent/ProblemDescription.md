# Problem #9: Largest Sum of Non-Adjacent (Hard)

## Asked By:

This problem was asked by Airbnb.

## Description:
 
Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be `0` or negative.

## Example:

For example, `[2, 4, 6, 2, 5]` should return `13`, since we pick `2`, `6`, and `5`. `[5, 1, 1, 5]` should return `10`, since we pick `5` and `5`.


## Note:
Follow-up: Can you do this in O(N) time and constant space?
