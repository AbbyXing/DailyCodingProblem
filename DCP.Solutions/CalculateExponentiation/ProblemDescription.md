# Problem #61: Calculate Exponentiation (Medium)

## Asked By:

This problem was asked by Google.

## Description:
 
Implement integer exponentiation. That is, implement the `pow(x, y)` function, where `x` and `y` are integers and returns `x^y`.  

Do this faster than the naive method of repeated multiplication.

## Example:

For example, `pow(2, 10)` should return `1024`.
