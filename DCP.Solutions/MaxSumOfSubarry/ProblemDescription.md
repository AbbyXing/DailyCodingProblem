# Problem #49: Maximum Sum Of Contiguous Subarray  (Medium)

## Asked By:

This problem was asked by Amazon.

## Description:
 
Given an array of numbers, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of the array.

## Example:
For example, given the array [34, -50, 42, 14, -5, 86], the maximum sum would be 137, since we would take elements 42, 14, -5, and 86.  

Given the array [-5, -1, -8, -9], the maximum sum would be 0, since we would not take any elements.

## Note:
Do this in O(N) time.
